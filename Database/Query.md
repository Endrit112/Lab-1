# SQL query to run the project

One to store an autogenerated table id, and another one to store the department name.

CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Department](
    [DepartmentId] [int] IDENTITY(1,1),
    [DepartmentName] [nvarchar](500)
)


Lets insert some records using insert query.

INSERT into [dbo].[Department] ([DepartmentName]) VALUES ('IT')
INSERT into [dbo].[Department] ([DepartmentName]) VALUES ('Support')
Now lets check the data in our table using select query.


select * from [dbo].[Department]

Let us similarly create table to store employee details.

We will be storing employee id, employee name, department to which the employee belongs to, the date of joining and also the uploaded profile picture file name.

CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Employee](
    [EmployeeId] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) ,
    [EmployeeName] [nvarchar](500) ,
    [Department] [nvarchar](500) ,
    [DateOfJoining] [datetime] ,
    [PhotoFileName] [nvarchar](500) 
)

INSERT into [dbo].[Employee] ([EmployeeName], [Department], [DateOfJoining], [PhotoFileName]) VALUES ('Bob', 'IT', '2021-06-17', 'anonymous.png')
